# DAV-Final-Project
This project examines the COVID-19 dynamics in Sweden including: the total number of deaths, cases, and hospitalizations in Sweden; the policies of Sweden and how this may have affected their COVID-19 numbers, and how Sweden's numbers compared to those of other countries. Sweden was the only european country to not go into lockdown with the hopes of gaining herd immunity faster.
